# CS480 - Lab 3: Calculator

### How to run the program:

#####(Assuming you have unzipped the lab files into the same directory as the README.md file)

- With the HTML file that is in the same folder as this file, open the HTML file in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Opera\*.
- The HTML file will have a text box at the top. Enter the expression you want to calculate in the text box and hit the enter key
  or hit the = sign at the bottom right.
- If the expression is valid, the text box will display the result of the calculation.
  - If the answer is NaN, that means the expression returned as undefined (i.e. Infinity, -Infinity, or an unevaluatable expression like 0/0).
- If the expression is invalid, the text box will display an error message:
  - "Invalid expression!"
  - "No expression entered."
  - Expression highlighted in red from the point of the error in the expression.
- The "Clear" button will clear the text box.
- The "Total Clear" button will clear the text box and the history.
- The "Delete" button deletes the rightmost character in the text box.

#### Note: The calculator only handles the functions displayed on the UI.

##### \* The Opera browser functions properly, but the UI is not displayed correctly.
